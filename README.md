### EarlyBird Github Pages Environment

Welcome to the EarlyBird Github Pages Environment!

Github Pages will be used to host the future website, with a "standby" webpage to join the waiting list for release

<br><br>

âš  **Note:** 
This "website" branch is not to be confused with the web app aspect of the EarlyBird app. The website is merely for descriptive and showcasing purposes.

For example, the download links to the web app and Android app will be placed on the website homepage
